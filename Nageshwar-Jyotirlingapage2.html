            Storys of Nageshwar Temple
          </blockquote>
        </h1>
        <p>The legend of this story is connected with the demon Daruka, who abducted Supriya, a follower of Lord Shiva. Along with Supriya, he also abducted several other people, sages, and Devas. They were kept as prisoners by the demon. The consort
          of the demon was called Daaruki, and she was an ardent devotee of Goddess Parvati.She was able to master the forest through the boon from the Goddess.</p>
        <p>The forest was then renamed as Darukavana. It is believed that wherever she went, the forest followed her. To save the demons from the wrath of the Gods, she summoned all her powers and hid the forest under the sea.</p>
        <p>To escape from the clutches of the demon, the Devas and other people started meditating on Lord Shiva.As Lord Shiva was highly moved by the prayers of the people, he came to their rescue and annihilated the demon. The Lingam installed by
          Sage Supriya is called Nageshwara Lingam.</p>
        <p>This shrine is also believed to be the place where Lord Shiva’s Phallus was made to shed because of the curse of a sage, as Lord Shiva’s magnificent look and charisma were enchanting the wives of many sages living in the forest. The world
          trembled with fear, and it was only after revoking the curse, that normalcy was restored. However, Lord Shiva promised the sages that he would stay here in the form of a Jyothirlinga and bless the people. Several archaeological studies
          conducted in this confirm that the temple is one of the oldest shrines. However, a lot of modifications were added later.</p>
