                <p>Kedarnath Temple (Sanskrit: केदारनाथ मंदिर, IAST: Kēdāranātha Mandira, lit. 'temple of the lord of the field') is a Hindu temple (shrine) dedicated to the Hindu God Shiva. The temple is located on the Garhwal Himalayan range near
                  the Mandakini river, in the state of Uttarakhand, India. Due to extreme weather conditions, the temple is open to the general public only between the months of April (Akshaya Tritiya) and November (Kartik Purnima, the autumn full
                  moon). During the winters, the vigraha (deity) from Kedarnath temple is carried down to Ukhimath where the deity is worshiped for the next six months. Kedarnath is seen as a homogenous form of Shiva, the 'Lord of Kedarkhand', the
                  historical name of the region.</p>

                <p>The temple is not directly accessible by road and has to be reached by a 22 kilometres (14 mi) uphill trek from Gaurikund. Pony and manchan service is available to reach the structure. According to Hindu legends, the temple was
                  initially built by Pandavas, and is one of the twelve Jyotirlingas, the holiest Hindu shrines of Shiva.Pandavas were supposed to have pleased Shiva by doing penance in Kedarnath.The temple is one of the four major sites in India's
                  Chota Char Dham pilgrimage of Northern Himalayas and is the first of the Panch Kedar pilgrimage sites. This temple is the highest among the 12 Jyotirlingas.Kedarnath was the worst affected area during the 2013 flash floods in North
                  India. The temple complex, surrounding areas, and Kedarnath town suffered extensive damage, but the temple structure did not suffer any "major" damage, apart from a few cracks on one side of the four walls which was caused by the
                  flowing debris from the higher mountains. A large rock among the debris acted as a barrier, protecting the temple from the flood. The surrounding premises and other buildings in the market area were heavily damaged.</p>

                <p>It is one of the 275 Paadal Petra Sthalams, expounded in Tevaram, a sacred Tamil Shaivite text written during 6th and 7th century by 63 saints called Nayanars. This temple is sung by Thirugnanasambandar, Appar, Sundarar and
                  Sekkizhar in their Tevaram texts.</p>

                  <h3>Some amazing facts and legends that are attached to this sacred and architecturally marvelous temple:</h3>
                </blockquote>
                <ul>
                  <li>Legend says that when Nar and Narayana-the two incarnations of Lord Vishnu performed a severe act of austerity in the Badrikashraya of Bharat Khand, they worshipped a Shivalingam which emerged out of the Earth beautifully. This
                    in turn pleased Lord Shiva who then appeared before Nar and Narayana and asked them to seek for a gift. Nar and Narayana then requested Lord Shiva to permanently reside as a Jyotirlingam at Kedarnath, so that the people who come
                    to worship Lord Shiva here won’t be enslaved to their miseries in life anymore.</li>
                  <li>The of Kedarnath dates back to the Mahabharata which states that when the Pandavas came to seek the blessings of Lord Shiva to free themselves from the sin of killing their cousins. Lord Shiva disguised himself as a humped
                    buffalo and hid himself at Kashi, then known as Guptkashi. The Pandavas eventually managed to discover Lord Shiva who was hiding beneath the ground with his hump in the ground and this impressed Lord Shiva then.

                    Another legend of the Kedar temple states that Goddess Parvati worshipped Kedareshwar to unite with Shiva as Ardhanareshwar.</li>
                  <li>An Interesting Fact about Kedarnath is the derivation of its name. A tale of the past says that once to save themselves from demons, the gods worshipped Lord Shiva for their protection. Lord Shiva appeared, disguised as a bull;
                    he said to the ‘Kodarum’ (whom to rip and whom to tear apart). With his horns and hooves Lord Shiva destroyed the demons and threw them into the Mandakini River. Thus the name Kedarnath is derive from the name ‘Kodarum.’</li>
                  <li>One of the Lesser Known Facts of Kedarnath is that The Bhairo Nath Temple which is located at a very short distance from Kedarnath Temple is a guardian of the Kedarnathji. It is believed that Bhaironathji guards the Kedarnath
                    Temple by keeping away the evil while the temple remains close. Therefore the Bhiaronath Temple is visited ceremoniously at the opening and closing of Kedarnath.</li>
                  <li>The Lingam at Kedarnath is one amongst the 12 Jyotilings of Lord Shiva. It is said to have blessed the Himalayas and keeps them soaked with the godliness of Lord Shiva. Its history dates back to when Nar and Narayana the two
                    incarnations of Lord Vishnu performed the act of austerity, Lord Shiva was impressed and they persuaded Lord Shiva to reside as a Jyotilingam in Kedarnath, so that devotees who would come to seek the blessing of Shiva will seek
                    salvation here.</li>
                  <li>The Kedarnath Temple is at least a 1000 year old temple which has been blessing the Himalayas and the people who visit it each year. It is said that during the 2013 floods in Uttarakhand the entire town of Kedarnath was ruined,
                    but the temple was not so harmed, as a huge rock behind the temple diverted the massive flood water coming towards the shrine.</li>
                  <li>The head priest of Kedarnath temple are of the Veerashaiva community of Karnataka also known as Raval. Although the Raval do not perform the puja in the temple. The puja’s are carried out on the instructions of the Raval by
                    other priests. The Raval moves with the deity to Ukimath during the winter season.</li>
                  <li>It is said that the Pandavas wanted to seek salvation from the sin of killing their cousins, to do so they set on a path to seek the blessings of Lord Shiva, who was ignorant towards the Pandavas and had moved to Kedar and
                    disguised himself as a bull and hid with other animals in the Himalayas. Although Bheema was able to recognize Lord Shiva through his hump when he with his magnanimous strength ripped apart two mountains, where Lord Shiva who was
                    submerging under the ground had his hump on the ground. Bheema got hold of it and that is how Lord Shiva blessed them.
