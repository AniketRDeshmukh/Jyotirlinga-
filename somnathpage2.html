            Storys of Somnath Temple
          </blockquote>
        </h1>
        <p>The triangular flag flutters in the breeze that blows across from the Arabian Sea. Seagulls fly above the blue waters. Devotees wait patiently in a queue for the much-awaited Somnath Darshan. A family poses in front of the imposing Somnath
          Temple for a picture. The sun is setting behind the temple in a blaze of orange, its rays making kaleidoscopic patterns on the rising and ebbing waters of the sea. A mother runs playfully as her toddler waddles behind her. The Somnath
          temple seems to be covered in an aura of peace and tranquility.</p>

        <p>This oasis of serenity was not always peaceful. Its peace had been ruptured and its sanctity violated repeatedly across time by invading marauders drawn by its riches and the fact that it symbolized faith, a faith that was alien to them
          and about which they had no inkling.</p>

        <p>Today, the Somnath temple is much bigger than its physical form. It is a standing monument to the faith and undying determination of the people who have inhabited the region from the beginning of time itself.</p>
<p>The Somnath temple is shrouded in an incredible aura of myths and legends. To understand the Somnath story one needs to dive deep into the mythology of the Somnath temple.</p>

<p>The Somnath temple story starts with the partiality of Chandra (the Moon God) to Rohini, one of his 27 wives who were all daughters of Daksha Prajapati, the son of Brahma. The sisters of Rohini were jealous of the extra attention that Rohini received and complained of this to their father. In spite of a warning, the Moon did not mend his ways and the angered Daksha Prajapati cursed him, because of which the Moon lost his lustre.</p>

<p>Alarmed with the curse of Daksha Prajapati, the Moon rushed to Prajapati Brahma, the creator of the World. Brahma advised him to visit Prabhas Teerth, bathe in the Triveni Sangam where the rivers Hiran, Saraswati, and Kapila meet and worship Lord Shiva there. The Moon did as he was advised and was relieved of his curse. As a token of gratitude he built a temple in Gold to honor Lord Shiva and the temple came to be known as Somnath.</p>

<p>Interpretations from the Puranas say that the Moon had built a golden temple and entrusted the worship and upkeep of the temple to the Sompura Brahmins whom he had created specifically to do Yajnas and other ceremonial worship to Lord Shiva during the prathishta or installation ceremony of the temple.</p>

<p>Even today there lives in Somnath a community of Sompura Brahmins who trace their ancestry to the moon. In fact, when the Somnath Temple was rebuilt after Independence, the masons and artists who gave shape to it were from the Sompura Salat community, a branch of the Sompura Brahmin community known for their architectural and artistic skills.</p>

<p>Legend has it that ages after the Moon God built the temple of God, Ravana built a temple in silver, and later in the Dwapara Yuga Shree Krishna had a temple of wood built at Somnath.</p>

<p>As per the information on the website of the Somnath Trust, it is believed that the first Somnath Temple was built during the tenth Treta Yug of the Vaivswat Manvantar and calculate this to be some 7,99,25,105 years ago.</p>
