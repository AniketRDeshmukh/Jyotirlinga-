              </blockquote>
              <p>The Kashi Vishwanath Temple is a famous Hindu temple dedicated to Lord Shiva. It is located in Vishwanath Gali of Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh in India. The temple stands on the western bank of the holy river Ganga, and is one of the
                twelve Jyotirlingas, the holiest of Shiva temples. The main deity is known by the names Shri Vishwanath and Vishweshwara (IAST: Vishveshvara or Vishveshvur) literally meaning Lord of the Universe. Varanasi was called Kashi ("shining")
                in ancient times, and hence the temple is popularly called Kashi Vishwanath Temple.

                The temple is considered a central part of worship in the Shaiva philosophy by Hindu scriptures. It had been demolished by many Muslim rulers many times, most recently by Aurangzeb, the sixth Mughal emperor who constructed the
                Gyanvapi Mosque on its site.[1] The current structure was built on an adjacent site by the Maratha ruler, Ahilya Bai Holkar of Indore in the year 1780.[2]

                Since 1983, the temple has been managed by the government of Uttar Pradesh.</p>

                <h3>Some amazing facts and legends that are attached to this sacred and architecturally marvelous temple:</h3>
              </blockquote>
              <ul>
                <li>According to records, the Kashi Vishwanath temple was found in 1490. Kashi has seen the rule of many kings both famous and not so famous. Did you know that it was also ruled by Buddhists for some time? Undoubtedly, the city has
                  seen its share of slaughter and destruction. The temples were plundered time and again by the Mughals. The original temples were re-built, then destroyed and re-built.</li>
                <li>FYI, Mughal Emperor Akbar gave permission to build the original temple, which was later destroyed by Aurangzeb – the sixth Mughal emperor, who ruled over almost the entire Indian subcontinent for a period of 49 years.</li>
                <li>The Kashi Vishwanath temple was last rebuilt and restored to its glory by the Queen of Indore, Rani Ahilya Bai Holkar. She took the initiative to restore the temple and also provided the funds for it. However, later Akbar’s great
                  grandson Aurangzeb had destroyed the temple and built a mosque in its place.</li>
                <li>The temple holds immense significance to Hindus as it is revered as one of the 12 Jyotirlingas of Lord Shiva. There is popular belief that Lord Shiva actually stayed here for some time.</li>
                <li>The Kashi Vishwanath Temple has three domes covered of gold! As per the popular belief, any wish is fulfilled if it is made after seeing the golden chatra.</li>
                <li>It is said the when news reached of Aurangzeb’s plans to destroy the temple, the idol of Shiva was hidden in a well to protect it from the destruction. The well, called the “well of wisdom”, still stands there between the mosque
                  and the temple. Don’t forget to visit it on your next trip here.</li>
                <li>The divine shrine is visited by more than 7 million devotees year on year and has been restored and beautified with the Kashi Vishwanath Dham project by the Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led government. On December 13, PM Modi
                  inaugurated Phase-1 of the project.</li>
