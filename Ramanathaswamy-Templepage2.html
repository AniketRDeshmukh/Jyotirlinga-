            Storys of Ramanathaswamy Temple
          </blockquote>
        </h1>
        <p>It is believed that the original shivling present here was made by Maan Sita, and worshipped by Lord Rama, while he was returning to Ayodhya, after killing Raavan.</p>
        <p>In the 12th century by the kings, belonging to the Pandya Dynasty expanded the temple structure. The rulers from Sri Lanka also contributed to the temple. The principal shrines were renovated by Jeyaveera Cinkaiariyan and his successor Gunaveera Cinkaiariyan, belonging to the Jaffna kingdom.</p>
        <p>The present structure of the Rameshwaram temple that we see today is a combined result of several devotees of Lord Shiva, spread over several centuries. The main credit of making the temple goes to the Setupatis of Ramanathapuram.</p>
        <p>It all started in the 17th century when Dalavai Setupati built a portion of the main eastern Gopuram. In the late 18th century, the world-famous third corridor (called “Chokkatan Mandapam”) was constructed by Muthuramalinga Setupati. Around the year 1500, the rulers of Vijayanagar built composite columns depicting Virabhadra holding sword and horn.</p>
        <p>There are 64 Tīrthas (holy water bodies) in and around the island of Rameswaram, out of which 24 (as mentioned in Skanda Puraan) are of great importance. It is believed that undertaking a pilgrimage to Rameswaram is equivalent to conducting a penance. Of these tirthas, 22 tirthas are located within the Ramanathaswamy temple. The number 22 is significant, as it indicates the 22 arrows found in Rama’s quiver.</p>
        <p>The first and major tirth is called ‘Agni Thirtham’, which is located in the sea. People take a holy dip in this tirth. It is believed that that child-less couples, who take a bath in this tirth and offer prayers to Lord Shiva at this tirth would be blessed with children. The most auspicious days to take a bath here are Purnima (full moon day) and Amavasya (new moon day)</p>
