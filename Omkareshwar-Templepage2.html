            Storys of Omkareshwar Temple
          </blockquote>
        </h1>
        <p>The name Omkareshwar means ‘Lord of Omkaara’, which is one of the Dwadasa Jyotirlinga shrines or the 12 shrines dedicated to Lord Shiva in the form of Jyotirlingam. Omkareshwar, located on the island of Mandhata, next to the Narmada River
          in Madhya Pradesh is a sacred island, shaped like the holy Hindu symbol ’ Om’ drawing hundreds of pilgrims to this temple town. At the confluence of Rivers Narmada & Kaveri, the devout have gathered for centuries to kneel before the
          Jyotirlinga (one of the twelve throughout India) at the temple of Shri Omkar Mandhata. This serene town is adorned with lofty hills, where the river Narmada forms a serene pool. Above this pool runs a cantilever type 270 feet hanging bridge
          which enhances the beauty of Omkareshwar. The Jyotirlinga shrines are places where Shiva appeared as a fiery column of light. Originally there were believed to be 64 jyotirlingas, but 12 are considered to be auspicious and holy. Each of the
          twelve Jyotirlinga sites takes the name of the presiding deity- a different manifestation of Shiva. </p>
        <p>According to the Hindu legend, Vindya, the deity of the Vindhya mountain range was worshipping Lord Shiva to conciliate himself from the sins committed. Thus, he created a sacred geometrical pattern & a lingam made of sand and clay. Shiva
          was pleased with his worship and appeared in two forms, Omkareshwar & Amaleswara. Since the mud mound was in the form of ‘Om’, this island was known to be called as Omkareshwar.
        </p>
        <p>The second story related to Mandhata and his son’s penance. King Mandhata of Ikshvaku clan ( an ancestor of Lord Ram) worshipped Lord Shiva here until the Lord manifested himself as a Jyotirlinga. Many scholars also narrate about how
          Mandhata’s sons, Ambarish & Muchukunda had practiced severe penance to please Lord Shiva as a result of which the mountain is named Mandhata. </p>
        <p>The third story was from the Hindu scriptures which says once upon a time there was great war between Devas (Gods) & Danavas (demons) in which the Danavas won. This was a big setback for the Devas and so they prayed to Lord Shiva. Pleased
          with their prayers, Shiva emerged in the form of Omkareshwar Jyotirlinga and defeated the Danavas. </p>
