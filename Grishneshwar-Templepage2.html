        <p>As per the another legend, Brahmavetta Sudharm and his wife Sudeha were lived in the Devagiri mountains. Even after the long time of their marriage, the couple was childless, thus Sudeha requested her husband to get merry with her sister
          Ghushma. Sudeha advise her sister Ghushma to worshiped lord Shiva and prepared lingas, worship them, and immerse them in the lake nearby. Lord Shiva pleased with her devotion and Ghushma blessed with a baby boy. Over the period, Sudeha had
          jealous of her sister and killed her son and threw into the lake where her sister had immerse the lingas. This lake is now popular as Shivalaya Sarovar.</p>
        <p>Ghushma came to know about the murder by her sister but she continue worshiping Lord Shiva with true devotion with belief in kindness of Lord Shiva. Once she went to immerse the linga, she saw her son walking towards her with blessing of
          Lord Shiva. Lord Shiva was requested to forgive her sister by Ghushma and stay at this place. Thus Lord Shiva has manifested himself as a jyotirlinga called Ghushmeshwar – Ishwar of Ghusma.</p>
