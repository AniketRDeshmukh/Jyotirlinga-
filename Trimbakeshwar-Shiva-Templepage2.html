              Storys of Trimbakeshwar Shiva Temple
            </blockquote>
          </h1>
          <p>This Shiva temple was built by Prime Minister of the Maratha Empire, Peshwa Balaji Baji Rao, also known as Nana Saheb, in the mid-18th century.</p>
          <p>The entire temple is built with black stone. The main feature of Trimbakeshwar Shiva Temple is that the jyotirlinga has three faces representing the gods - Shiva, Vishnu and Brahma. They all exist within the hollow space within the Shivalinga. Hence the name Trimbakeshwara (Three Lords). They are covered by a jewelled crown that is believed to date to the era of the Pandavas.</p>
          <p>You will also find images of Rama, Krishna, Ganga, Parasurama and Kedarnath among others. There are also monasteries of saints in this temple.</p>
          <p>The temple has a well called Amritavarshini. It also has a Kushavarta or sacred pond, which is believed to be the source of the Godavari.</p>
          <p>It is said that Gautama rishi lived on the Brahmagiri hills along with his wife, Ahalya. While there was famine everywhere else on the land, inside the rishiâ€™s ashram, there were abundant food grains. This was because the gods had blessed him because of his steadfast devotion and regular prayers. The other rishis felt jealous of him and sent a cow into his fields.</p>
          <p>When Gautama tried to frighten the cow away from his fields, it died. For the sin of killing a cow, Gautama worshipped Lord Shiva to release the Ganga River and let her flow into his ashram to purify it. Pleased with his devotion, Lord Shiva released Ganga and told her to stay there. The Kushavarta or sacred pond that exists now is the source of the Godavari. (People worship the Godavari as Ganga.) The sage requested Lord Shiva also to make the site his abode, which the Lord did in the form of the jyotirlinga.</p>
